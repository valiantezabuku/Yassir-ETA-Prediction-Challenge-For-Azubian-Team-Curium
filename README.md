## **Methodology**
The project was conducted using the CRISP-DM framework, which included the following steps:

| **Phase**               | **Actions**                                                                                                          |
|-------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Business Understanding** | Defined key business questions and objectives for improving ETA predictions.                                       |
| **Data Understanding & Preparation** | Collected, cleaned, and processed trip and weather data to build the foundation for modeling.             |
| **Modeling & Evaluation** | Developed and tested multiple models, with a focus on minimizing the RMSE to achieve better accuracy.               |
| **Deployment**          | Implemented a Shiny app for stakeholders to interact with the model and created a FastAPI endpoint for real-time use. |

## **Key Insights**
| **Insight**                | **Business Implication**                                                                                         |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Weather Impact**         | Moderate influence on ETA, suggesting the need for operational adjustments during adverse weather conditions.     |
| **Peak Hour Optimization** | Morning rush hours are challenging, while evenings are more efficient, offering opportunities for resource optimization. |
| **Weekday vs. Weekend**    | No significant difference in trip durations, indicating stable service levels across the week.                   |
